    "reasoning": "This design prioritizes simplicity and security for user authentication. It focuses on storing user data in a dedicated collection (`/users/{userId}`) with path-based ownership. This approach is highly secure, as it naturally restricts access to user-specific data. It is very debuggable since the authorization rules will simply validate that the request is authenticated and the `request.auth.uid` matches the `userId` path parameter.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** The design inherently achieves authorization independence because access control is based directly on the `userId` in the path. There are no `get()` calls to other documents required to validate access.\n\n**QAPs Support:** This structure directly supports secure list operations for user-owned data. Security rules can easily restrict listing operations to only allow a user to access their own data based on the `userId`."

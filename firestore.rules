/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for FlightTrackr application.
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where each user can only access their own data.
 * @data_structure All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}` matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * @key_security_decisions User listing is disabled. Write access is strictly limited to the owning user. Data shape validation is relaxed for prototyping.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization  N/A - Path-based ownership eliminates the need for data denormalization.
 * @structural_segregation N/A - All user data is inherently private.

     * @deny (create) User with UID 'user_xyz' cannot create a document at /users/user_abc.
     * @allow (get) User with UID 'user_abc' can read their own document at /users/user_abc.
     * @deny (get) User with UID 'user_xyz' cannot read the document at /users/user_abc.
     * @allow (update) User with UID 'user_abc' can update their own document at /users/user_abc.
     * @deny (update) User with UID 'user_xyz' cannot update the document at /users/user_abc.
     * @allow (delete) User with UID 'user_abc' can delete their own document at /users/user_abc.
     * @deny (delete) User with UID 'user_xyz' cannot delete the document at /users/user_abc.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership; only the user with the matching UID can read, write, update, or delete their own document.
